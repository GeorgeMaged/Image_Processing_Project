## Project Description:
All of us are somehow connected to elderly people like grandparents, and as they are becoming older in age, the more medicine and pills they might need to have. However, the main issue here can be that elderly people might forget what time they have to take which pills. Moreover, majority of old people can't have a clear sight or vision to read the prescriptions clearly and might be confused which medicine was taken for certain symptoms, that might lead to dangerous consequences.

Our project aims to solve these problems in order for them to safely take the right pills in the right time. A mobile application that takes as input the photo of a certain medicine, recognizes its name and then outputs a voice with its name and the times at which the pills should be taken as well as the right dose for the person taking the pills, Moreover the application sets an alarm at the times at which each medicine should be taken.
